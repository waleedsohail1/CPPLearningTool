Single-Dimensional Arrays:

C++ provides a data structure, the array, which stores a fixed-size 
sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to
store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of 
an array as a collection of variables of the same type. All arrays consist 
of contiguous memory locations. The lowest address corresponds to the first
element and the highest address to the last element.


DECLARATION:

To declare an array in C++, the programmer specifies the type of the 
elements and the number of elements required by an array.


Syntax :
-------------------------------
 type arrayName [ arraySize ]; 
-------------------------------

This is called a single-dimension array. The arraySize must be an integer
constant greater than zero and type can be any valid C++ data type. 

For example, to declare a 10-element array called balance of type double,
use this statement:

double balance[10];
