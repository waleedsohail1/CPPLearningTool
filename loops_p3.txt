while LOOP:

A while loop statement in C programming language repeatedly executes a target
statement as long as a given condition is true. 

Syntax:
	while(condition)
	{
   		Statement(s); 
   		increment/decrement;
	}

Execution Process:

Statement(s) may be a single statement or a block of statements. 
The condition may be any expression, and true is any nonzero value. 
The loop iterates while the condition is true.
The increment/decrement is essential otherwise the loop will become
infinite.

Example:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main ()
{
   /* local variable definition */
   int a = 10;

   /* while loop execution */
   while( a < 20 )
   {
      cout << a << ", ";
      a++;
   }
 
   return 0;
}
