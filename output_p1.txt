		********** PART-A (DESCRIPTION) **********


Description:

C++ uses a convenient abstraction called streams to perform input and output 
operations in sequential media such as the screen, the keyboard or a file. 
The "iostream" library is included for output operations.For formatted output
operations, cout is used together with the insertion operator, which is written
as << (i.e., two "less than" signs).


In Action:

By default, the standard output of a program points at the screen. So with the
cout operator and the "insertion" operator (<<) you can print a message onto 
the screen. Let’s take a look at an example:


Program:

	#include<iostream>
	using namespace std;

	int main()
	{
		cout << "Hello World!"; //This is the output line.
		return 0;
	}



This program will display "Hello World!" (without double quotes) on the display
screen.
