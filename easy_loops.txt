1.  Each pass through a loop is called a/an
      [a] enumeration
      [b] iteration
      [c] culmination
      [d] pass through@
 
2.  Which looping process checks the test condition at the 
end of the loop?

      [a] for
      [b] while
      [c] do-while
      [d] no looping process checks the test condition at the end@

3.  A continue statement causes execution to skip to

      [a] the return 0; statement
      [b] the first statement after the loop
      [c] the statement following the continue statement
      [d] the next iteration of the loop@

4.  In a group of nested loops, which loop is executed the most 
number of times?

      [a] the outermost loop
      [b] the innermost loop
      [c] all loops are executed the same number of times
      [d] cannot be determined without knowing the size 
       of the loops@

5.  The statement  i++;  is equivalent to

      [a] i = i + i;
      [b] i = i + 1;
      [c] i = i - 1;
      [d] i --; @

6.  Which looping process is best used when the number of iterations is 
known?

      [a] for
      [b] while
      [c] do-while
      [d] all looping processes require that the iterations be known@


7.  What's wrong?  for (int k = 2, k <=12, k++)

      [a] the increment should always be ++k
      [b] the variable must always be the letter i when using a for loop
      [c] there should be a semicolon at the end of the statement
      [d] the commas should be semicolons@

8.  What's wrong?  while( (i < 10) && (i > 24))

       [a] the logical operator && cannot be used in a test condition
      [b] the while loop is an exit-condition loop
      [c] the test condition is always false
      [d] the test condition is always true@

9.  If there is more than one statement in the block of a for loop, 
which of the following must be placed at the beginning and the ending 
of the loop block?

      [a] parentheses ( )
      [b] braces { }
      [c] brackets [ ]
      [d] arrows < >@

10.  What's wrong?  (x = 4 && y = 5) ? (a = 5) ; (b = 6);

       [a] the question mark should be an equal sign
      [b] the first semicolon should be a colon
      [c] there are too many variables in the statement
      [d] the conditional operator is only used with apstrings@
