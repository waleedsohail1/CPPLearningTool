		********** PART-B (APPLICATIONS) **********


APPLICATION- 1 :

C++ uses a convenient abstraction called streams to perform input and output 
The << operator can be used multiple times in a single statement. Take a look
at an example:

Program:

	#include<iostream>
	using namespace std;

	int main()
	{
		cout << "Hello, " << "this is a test " << "string.";
		return 0;
	}


OUTPUT : Hello, this is a test string.


APPLICATION- 2:

The cout operator does not put a line break at the end of the output. 
So if you want to print two sentences you will have to use the new-line
character ( \n ).

Program :

	#include<iostream>
	using namespace std;

	int main()
	{
		cout << "Sentence 1. \n";
		cout << "Sentence 2. \n ";  
		return 0;
	}

OUTPUT : 
Sentence 1.
Sentence 2.

It is possible to use the endl manipulator instead of the new-line character.
For example:

        cout << "This is one sentence." << endl;
	cout << "This is another." << endl;
