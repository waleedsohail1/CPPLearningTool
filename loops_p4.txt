do while LOOP:

Unlike for and while loops, which test the loop condition at the top of 
the loop, the do...while loop in C programming language checks its 
condition at the bottom of the loop.

Syntax:
	do
	{
 	  statement(s);

	}while( condition );

Execution Process:

Notice that the conditional expression appears at the end of the loop, 
so the statement(s) in the loop execute once before the condition is tested.
If the condition is true, the flow of control jumps back up to do, and the 
statement(s) in the loop execute again. This process repeats until the given 
condition becomes false.


EXAMPLE PROGRAM:
------------------------------------------
Example:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main ()
{
   /* local variable definition */
   int a = 10;

   /* do loop execution */
   do
   {
       cout << a << ", ";
       a = a + 1;
   }while( a < 20 );
 
   return 0;
}
-------------------------------------------

OUTPUT:

10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,
