Q1 : What is wrong with the following while loop?
while ( sum <= 1000 )
sum = sum - 30;

a. The parentheses should be braces.
b. Braces are required around sum = sum – 30;.
c. There should be a semicolon after while ( sum <= 1000 ).
d. sum = sum – 30 should be sum = sum + 30 or else 
the loop may never end.
