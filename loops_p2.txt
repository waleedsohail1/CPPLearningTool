for LOOP:

A for loop is a repetition control structure that allows you to efficiently 
write a loop that needs to execute a specific number of times.

Syntax:
	for ( init; condition; increment )
	{
  		 statement(s);
	}

Execution Process:

1. The init step is executed first, and only once. This step allows you to 
declare and initialize any loop control variables. You are not required to 
put a statement here, as long as a semicolon appears.

2. Next, the condition is evaluated. If it is true, the body of the loop is 
executed. If it is false, the body of the loop does not execute and flow of 
control jumps to the next statement just after the for loop.

3. After the body of the for loop executes, the flow of control jumps back up 
to the increment statement. This statement allows you to update any loop 
control variables. This statement can be left blank, as long as a semicolon 
appears after the condition.

4. The condition is now evaluated again. If it is true, the loop executes and
 the process repeats itself (body of loop, then increment step, and then 
again condition). After the condition becomes false, the for loop terminates.

EXAMPLE PROGRAM:
------------------------------------------
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main ()
{
   /* for loop execution */
   for( int a = 10; a < 20; a = a + 1 )
   {
      cout << a<< ", ";
   }
 
   return 0;
}
-------------------------------------------

OUTPUT:

10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,
