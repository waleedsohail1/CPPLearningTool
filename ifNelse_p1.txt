		********** PART-A (DESCRIPTION) **********


Description:
The ability to control the flow of your program, letting it make decisions 
on what code to execute, is valuable to the programmer. The if statement 
allows you to control if a program enters a section of code or not based 
on whether a given condition is true or false.

Here are the relational operators, as they are known, along with examples:
>     greater than              5 > 4 is TRUE
<     less than                 4 < 5 is TRUE
>=    greater than or equal     4 >= 4 is TRUE
<=    less than or equal        3 <= 4 is TRUE
==    equal to                  5 == 5 is TRUE
!=    not equal to              5 != 4 is TRUE

The if STATEMENT :-

The structure of an if statement is as follows:

if ( TRUE )
  Execute the next statement

Here is a simple example that shows the syntax:

if ( 5 < 10 )
  cout<<"Five is now less than ten, that's a big surprise";
