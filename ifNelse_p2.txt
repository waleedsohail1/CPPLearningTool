Else :-

The "else" statement effectively says that whatever code after it (whether a 
single line or code between brackets) is executed if the if statement is FALSE. 

Example:

if ( TRUE ) 
{
  // Execute these statements if TRUE
}
else 
{
  // Execute these statements if FALSE
}

Else If:-

Another use of else is when there are multiple conditional statements that may
all evaluate to true, yet you want only one if statement's body to execute. 
You can use an "else if" statement following an if statement and its body; 
that way, if the first statement is true, the "else if" will be ignored, but
if the if statement is false, it will then check the condition for the else 
if statement. If the if statement was true the else statement will not be 
checked. It is possible to use numerous else if statements to ensure that only 
one block of code is executed.

Example:

if ( <condition> ) 
{
  // Execute these statements if <condition> is TRUE
}
else if ( <another condition> ) 
{
  // Execute these statements if <another condition> is TRUE and
  // <condition> is FALSE
}
